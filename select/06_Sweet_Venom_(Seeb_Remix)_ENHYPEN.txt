Sweet venom
Hey
I see your face you're up to something
You make me nervous with your love games
Drunk on your poison in my blood veins
I'll never be the same, now I'm
Spinning in my room
Feeling kinda strange
Wishing I could get another taste of your
Sweet venom-nom-nom
Yeah, all I need is your poison
Paralyzed, paradise on my tongue
So alive, I could die, gimme some
Sweet
Sweet venom
(I would give up heaven if I had to)
(Just to get another taste of)
(I would give up heaven if I had to)
(Just to get another taste of)
Sweet, sweet venom
Sweet, sweet venom
Sweet, sweet venom
Sweet, sweet venom
Whoa
My heart is broken in my ripped clothes
My hands are shaking when you let go
And if it kills me I still want ya, it's torture
Your touch is chemical, now I'm
Spinning in my room
Feeling kinda strange
Wishing I could get another taste of your
Sweet venom-nom-nom
Yeah, all I need is your poison
Paralyzed, paradise on my tongue
So alive, I could die, gimme some
Sweet
Sweet venom
(I would give up heaven if I had to)
(Just to get another taste of)
(I would give up heaven if I had to)
(Just to get another taste of)
Sweet, sweet venom
Sweet, sweet venom
Sweet, sweet venom
Sweet, sweet venom
I would give up heaven if I had to
Just to get another taste of your
Sweet venom-nom-nom
Yeah, all I need
Sweet venom
