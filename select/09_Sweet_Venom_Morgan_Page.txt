Oh my oh my
Caught in your head
Like getting lost in your eyes
Got lost in your eyes
You're what I like, mm-hm
Tripping out mad
How you're making me lose my mind
Make me lose my mind

You'll die for my system
But I can't resist it
'Cause you're what I'm missing

It's on
Heart beating like a bomb
My brain is going dumb
I feel you in my veins
Like sweet venom
So come and give me some
Your love is what I want
I feel you in my veins
Like sweet venom

My brain is going dumb
Heart beating like a bomb
My brain is going dumb
I feel you in my veins
Like sweet venom

Mm-hm
Give me a lifeline
Don't wanna leave alone
I can't leave alone
Oh no no no
Tell me you'll be mine
'Cause I got no control
I got no control

You'll die for my system
But I can't resist it
'Cause you're what I'm missing

It's on
Heart beating like a bomb
My brain is going dumb
I feel you in my veins
Like sweet venom
So come and give me some
Your love is what I want
I feel you in my veins
Like sweet venom

My brain is going dumb
Heart beating like a bomb
My brain is going dumb
I feel you in my veins
Like sweet venom

I feel you in my veins
Like sweet venom
